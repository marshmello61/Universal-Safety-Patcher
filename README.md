# Universal-Safety-Patcher

Universal Safety Patcher that fixes the safety net on all devices without giving vendor error message.

## Why to use

If your safety net is not passing in magisk, just flash this module to make it pass.
Other modules gives the vendor error message, that flash the correct system image as your vendor image and system "xxxx" not matching.. But this module will never give this error.
